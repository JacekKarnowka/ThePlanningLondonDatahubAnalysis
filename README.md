### The planning London Datahub 
The Planning DataHub is a collaborative project between all of the Planning Authorities in London to build a single open data set of development proposals in the planning process to enable monitoring of how our City is changing and develop a shared understanding of the data.

The Planning London Datahub is an interactive tool that holds detailed information on planning applications, permissions, commencements and completions in Greater London. It takes the place of the former London Development Database (LDD) as the central repository for information on proposed and coming development. The LDD only contained information on applications once they had received permission, whereas the new system captures applications earlier in the process (from the point of validation).
